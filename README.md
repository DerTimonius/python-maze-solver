# Maze Solver

A simple maze solver written in Python, GUI made with tkinter

## Description

I built this maze solver for two reasons: to refresh my Python skills and to practice path-finding algorithms.

I opted to use DFS here, but I might add BFS or A\* in the future.

## Prerequisites

To run this locally, make sure that you have Python and tkinter installed.

After cloning this repo, simple run the following and see the maze get created and solved:

```sh clone
python main.py
```
